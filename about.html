								<p><b>Financial Accountant at MPS - Macau Professional Services (2018-2021):</b></p>
								<p>I arrived in Macau from Portugal in May 2018, to work at local group <a href="https://www.ceslasia.com/">CESL Asia</a> as a financial accountant for one of its subsidiaries, 
								<a href="https://www.ceslasia.com/en/MPS">MPS - Macau Professional Services</a>.
								For 3 years, I did all the accounting tasks for a company averaging USD 10M in yearly revenue with a headcount of over 100 staff, mostly composed of engineers or architects.
								As a financial accountant, I understood how important it is to be organized and thorough, especially regarding supporting documents for the accounting entries that I made.
								I also realized that to provide accurate reports, I would have to put extra effort into gathering information from operations to book accruals accurately and in the right periods,
								which eventually led me to dig into all project contracts, enabling me to provide very accurate revenue and cost (manpower) forecasts that both the operations and finance teams could rely on.
								Process improvement was another area of focus, and becoming an advanced Excel user allowed me to automate almost every report I had to prepare which in turn freed time for 
								me to consider a broader range of business and stakeholder needs. Finally, I had the responsibility of coordinating audit matters directly with the auditors, Deloitte (2019) and PWC (2020-2021),
								a process that was simplified by the fact that my accounting entries were backed by adequate supporting documents and were in digital format, which exempted the auditors from traveling to our offices.</p>
								<p><b>Project Controller / Business Analyst at MPS - Macau Professional Services (2021-2023): </b></p>
								<p>With relevant departures at the top of the company, 3 Executive Directors left in less than 1 year, the newly appointed Principal Director, who had been the Construction Manager
								of all of the Venetian properties for the past 20 years, entrusted me with the position of Project Controller / Business Analyst.
								With more time to focus on operations, I was able to create Excel tables that included the information of hundreds of project contracts and design a data model
								that connected these tables to the MS SQL Server finance ERP (Microsoft Dynamics) and also the internally developed HR ERP that provided the time allocation by project (costs),
								allowing for timely billing, technical and regulatory (licensing) follow-up, accounts receivable follow-up, budget and timeline variance review, and actual status reporting at a glance, 
								through a Power BI dashboard, as seen on my portfolio page, that was used as the background for a monthly progress meeting conducted by the Principal Director, me, and the Project Manager.
								As I understood the business requirements of project directors and managers, I was also working closely with the group's Executive Director for IT and Operations in developing
								the internally created HR ERP.</p>
								<p><b>Manager at Manuela Antonio - Lawyers and Notaries (2023-): </b></p>
								<p>Looking for a new challenge, which coincided with the end of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Macau, I took the role I am currently in, 
								Manager at <a href="https://www.mantonio.net/">Manuela Antonio - Lawyers and Notaries</a>, one of Macau's most well-known law firms.
								The main goal was to continue developing my operational control skills and add skills I didn't have in other business units such as Marketing, IT, and HR. As part of this position,
								I see every single e-mail that comes in or out of the firm's mailbox, knowing the status of most of the work-in-progress and ensuring deadlines are kept and invoices are 
								sent on time. I designed work-in-progress, accounts receivable, number and money value of opened processes by month and business segment reports, and others based on Excel tables and 
								the MS SQL Server ERP. Leading the Marketing and Business Development initiatives, I optimized the website with an investment of just USD 100, increasing the monthly traffic by three times
								what it had been, which brought two additional recurring business segments by suggesting and adjusting content through Google search engine data analysis. 
								I am also responsible for researching and budgeting legal events and visits to law firms in other jurisdictions that could potentially provide new business opportunities, as well as 
								organizing and coordinating events, including a successful gala dinner attended by 200 pax, among them government officials, at St. Regis Hotel. By leading the IT initiatives, the firm transitioned to
								the Microsoft 365 Business environment, keeping the main working tool (Outlook) uninterrupted, enabling cloud backup of data (crucial to avoid data loss from old computers), and facilitating
								work from home necessities. Also in IT, I developed from scratch the firm's IT Policies documentation including Change Management, Risk Management, and Vendor Selection policies, as well
								as Cybersecurity training materials for the staff. This was particularly important because the lack of these documents and procedures kept the firm away from major financial institution's legal
								panels, which had negative financial repercussions. As a result, the firm's dependency on a below-par IT services provider was mitigated and relied upon for only minor issues. Finally, regarding HR,
								I oversee recruitment, conduct interviews, onboarding, annual leave planning, payroll, and development of internal policies and procedures including the definition of career development paths.</p>
								<p><b>Personal: </b>In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, reading, cinema, cooking, and exercising outdoors, particularly at the Guia Fortress, which I usually do 4 times a week. I also
								enjoy traveling, having been to most of Southeast Asia's capitals and the Southwest China region, visiting Chongqing a couple of times.</p>
